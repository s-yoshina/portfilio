=Search in Rotated Sorted Array=

A program that searches for a given number in a sorted array (in ascending order)
that is rotated around the first item in the array. If the number is not found,
the program returns -1. If it is found, the program returns the position of that
number in the rotated array.

<Examples>
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
