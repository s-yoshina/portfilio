=Multiply Polynomials=

A program that multiplies two polynomials and returns the product as a list.
The polynomial entered must be a order from the lowest order to the highest order.
Three different ways of calculating the product are shown using a brute force
method and a divide and conquer algorithm.
Program made with reference to the following document:

<Example>
input:
a = [2,0,5,7] *Represents 2+(5x^2)+(7x^3)
b = [3,4,2] *Represents 3+4x+(2x^2)
output:
[6,8,19,41,38,14] *Represents 6+8x+(19x^2)+(41x^3)+(38x^4)+(14x^5)
