=Othello=

A program where the user can play Othello against a computer. The moves played
during the game are stored within a file called 'save.txt'.

<How to play>
1. Who goes first, the player or the computer, is chosen at random.

2. Enter the coordinate where you want to place a piece. (Ex. a6)
  - The x axis is labeled with letters 'a' to 'h'.
  - The y axis is labeled with numbers 1 to 8.
  - Pieces can only be placed where your piece sandwiches your opponents pieces with
    your pieces in the diagonal, horizontal, and vertical direction.

3. Moves are played until the board is completely filled or until no moves can
be played by both players.

4. The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins.
